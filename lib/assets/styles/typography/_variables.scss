// We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
// page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
// immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
// such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
// We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
// definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
// the performance hit.
// We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
// widely available.
